# dotfiles
Just a series of config files for my terminal and other stuff

## Requirements
The only Requirement is a good Nerd Font. Otherwise the starship prompt and the nvim configuration won't work properly.
I use [JetBrains Mono Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads)

## Installation
- To install the starship prompt: https://starship.rs/guide/#%F0%9F%9A%80-installation<br/>
- To install oh-my-zsh: https://ohmyz.sh/#install
- For tmux on MAC use:
  ```bash
  brew install tmux
  ```	
- For alacritty go on [their site](https://alacritty.org/)
